Cube Movements
    1) Get Jest working correctly so that I can test cube movements
    2) Write out testing data for cube movement tests
    3) Write out cube movement tests
    4) Fix cube movements such that tests pass

UI Cube Movements
    1) Provide extnesible UI for cube movements
        + reset (solved cube)
        + all basic movements 
        + configure initial state (nice have)
    2) Give some textual representation of cube for now
    3) Might be able to use simple canvas to do basic 2d rendering

Solving Cube
    0) Research solving techniques and pick one
    1) Translate algorithm to js solver
    2) Test repeatedly with many cube configurations
    3) Figure out a way to test rubiks cube solvability

Rendering Cube
    0) Familiarize self w/ what can be done in ThreeJS
    1) Figure out how to structure a rubiks cube in ThreeJS
    2) Create rubiks cube structure in ThreeJS
    3) Figure out way to map internal cube data representation w/ how the cube
    should be rendered
    4) Figure out how to create transformation when doing cube movement 
    5) Modify UI such that the state, rendering, and transformation work fine
